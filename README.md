## Forwarding upon submission

By default the form refreshes for the next entry once the data has been submitted. If users are only supposed to enter one entry (e.g. in an online survey) you can send them to another website upon submission. To use this feature you need to 1) use the Online-Only form of the form, and 2) add `return_url=https://www.somewebsite.com` to your URL.
